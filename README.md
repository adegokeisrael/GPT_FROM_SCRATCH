## Introduction
The GPT model, introduced by OpenAI, is a powerful generative language model based on the transformer architecture. This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the GPT model, allowing users to gain insights into its inner workings and customize it for various natural language processing tasks.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)

## Usage
To use the GPT model, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to train or use the pre-trained model.
4. Customize the model architecture or training process as needed.

## Architecture
The GPT model consists of a multi-layer transformer encoder architecture with self-attention mechanisms. The implementation includes the following components:
- Tokenizer: Converts text input into tokens for processing.
- Positional Encoding: Adds positional information to token embeddings.
- Transformer Encoder Layers: Stack of transformer encoder layers.
- Output Layer: Linear layer for generating output tokens.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the GPT model:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from gpt import GPT

# Initialize GPT model
model = GPT(vocab_size=10000, num_layers=6, num_heads=8, d_model=512, d_ff=2048)

# Train the model or load pre-trained weights
# (Code for training or loading weights goes here)

# Generate text
input_text = "Once upon a time"
generated_text = model.generate(input_text, max_length=100)
print("Generated Text:", generated_text)
